            <p class="lead">Whether you code at home for fun or you work as a software engineer at the enterprise level, some type of version control is relevant to your work. More specifically, GIT is a version control system that many people use as their preferred choice of version control. 

Some advantages of GIT are that many people can work on one project at one time, you can revert back to previous versions, and you can look to see which person on the project changed what. BY allowing many members to work on the project at the same time, GIT helps keep large projects more organized. The organizational component is important when creating successful projects because it allows for users to identify which features, or which member of the project added parts of code. This can be a helpful tool when troubleshooting. Finally, by reverting to previous versions of the project, users can make sure that each version of this particular project work properly. These functions of GIT make this particular version control system very important to computer programmers of any skill level. BY using a system like GIT a programmer can achieve successful projects in a relatively short amount of time.

            <p class="lead">To begin, although there is one name that is attributed to making GIT it is also important to note that this was an open sources project and many people contributed to the birth of IGT. Linus Torvalds, otherwise known as the creator of Linux, spearheaded a motion to create a free and open sourced version control system. Since its development in 2005, it has many improvements and different updates. 

An important takeaway from the history of this project is that it came about because there was a need in the community from it. This is relevant because in programming, unless you have a strong desire

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Why GIT? After reading articles about why GIT is so popular among developers, it is important to understand why it is the preferred version control system is so widely used. Aside from the many features that GIT includes, the main difference between the systems is the way GIT thinks about data. By storing data overtime, GIT makes it possible for users the branch off and work on different features at a time while storing all information associated with the project. This is important when having to revert to past changes and look to see who worked on which branches of the project. 

Although this does not sound like it is a large feature, it is important to know who wwote which lines of code. This can be important when testing comes into play. For example, you do not want the same person testing code as the person who wrote it. This is due to the fact that the person who wrote the code will know everything about their code, therefor it would not make sense for them to test it as well.

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Integrity</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Because the folks who had a hand in creating Git had integrity, this version control system contains some checkpoints that most do not. For example, it is impossible to change the contents of any directory without Git knowing about it. This is extremely important to developers because if you lose files in transition of one of your files is corrupted, this system can detect it. 

While you might be thinking your project is small and would not have to deal with corruption, this is not the case. Any project is susceptible to lose files along the way. An important tip is to always make sure you are paying attention to your file structure. In my experiences, I try to make sure I am constantly previewing my site to make sure all the code I have written is running error free.

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Adds Data</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While you are working on a project using GIT you are always going to be adding data to the Git database. This is a great feature for enterprises because it is important for them to have the data that their employers work on. On the other hand, it can also be a risk for these same employers. For example, if you are a large financial institution you may not want client data to be on the Git databases. However, there are many contacts and laws in place that protects this data. 

However, because of all the positives of having a running log of data, Git is the preferred system for companies to use. The positives of having data available severely outweigh any negatives.
